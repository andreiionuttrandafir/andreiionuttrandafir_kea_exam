			<p id="paragrafe">An energic and positive person, I was born in a small town near Danube river, in Braila, Romania. I was raised in a modest and lovely family, a family that offered me all the affection and education I had need to become the person I am today.</p>

				I have a brother, named Cosmin, who is a karateka, a gamer and a mathematician. We are pretty opposide one of another, but we get along all the time. </p>

		 		I have a little cat, called Yuki, who is pretty crazy in it's own way, but we love her completely. </p>

			<p id="paragrafe"> Along the way, I picked up a photo camera, and we became very good friends, introducing me to photography. I won competitions, I got well known in my town and I got hired as a wedding photographer. My colleagues taught me a lot of things about photography and videography and they became one of the persons I appreciate the most. </p>

				Martial arts were a big part of my life, because I have practiced karate-do shotokan and I had multiple national championship titles. I have obtained the 2 kyu grade, brown belt and I'm very close to the black one.</p>

			Gas, tires, steering wheel a road and a friend to drive with. That's what being a petrolhead means to me.</p>

			In my opinion, the key to success is to have good friends along the way to support each other. </p>
